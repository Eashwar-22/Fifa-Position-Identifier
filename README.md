# Fifa Position Identifier

----
### Objectives:
* Identify a player's ideal position on the football pitch based on the individual attributes provided using Tree based Classification.
* Create a web application for the project, providing the attributes as an input from which the ideal position is printed as the output.

### Overview:

Over 25 million people around the world on average play the yearly editions of FIFA, 
a football simulation video game. Its popularity is majorly focused around Career Mode 
and FIFA Ultimate Edition, two of the best game modes within the game. 
The game features over 15,000 real life players playing for around 700 different clubs as seen in FIFA 21,
the 28th installment of the global series.<br>
With new players and their real time performance based cards being released into the platform on a weekly basis, FUT has always kept it going for the excited gamers 
and provides them all a new direction in experimenting play styles based on the players' updated
attributes. The intention of this simple project is to understand where a player can offer his maximum potential on the pitch 
based on the in-game attributes (ranging between 0 and 100).<br><br>

_The above illustration describes the in-game stats (attriibutes) of one of the most used players in
FUT 21 edition, Kylian Mbappe. Originally the player is positioned at striker (ST) but not necessarily at his very best position as 
users tend to switch in-game positions of players at the start of the game, judging their abilities based on their stats._

The goal of the project is to identify the ideal position of a player by providing the player
attributes as an input.

### Future Updates
To provide more than one position as a recommendation based on multi label classification.
